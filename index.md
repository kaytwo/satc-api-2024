title: 2024 NSF SaTC Aspiring PI Workshop
---

## About

The [Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace program (SaTC)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/secure-trustworthy-cyberspace-satc) is the premiere NSF program for supporting research in computer security and privacy. Relatively new principal investigators (PIs), whom we term "aspiring PIs," often find writing their first successful SaTC funding proposal intimidating and difficult. To reduce this barrier, we intend to hold the 2024 SaTC Aspiring PI workshop **Thursday-Friday, May 9-10, 2024 in person on the University of Chicago campus in Chicago, IL.** This workshop is open to current and soon-to-be appointed faculty members who qualify for submitting a grant proposal to the NSF SaTC program, including researchers whose past grant submissions to the SaTC program were declined for funding.

Participation in the workshop is by invitation based on applications submitted by interested researchers. To apply, **please submit all application materials by {{site.deadline}}; the submission link will open in the coming days**.

The purpose of this workshop is to provide individuals who have never received a SaTC award with tips and tools for navigating the NSF’s proposal review process, with a focus on SaTC's goals. We expect that doing so will increase both the quality of their proposal submissions and, in turn, the number of proposals funded. To that end, this workshop will provide participants with opportunities to meet and network with mentors in addition to attending panels and sessions covering topics such as:

- Crafting a Research Proposal Narrative
- Research Project Development
- Presentation Strategies
- The Panel Review Process
- Mock-Review Modules
- Overview of Common Proposal Mistakes
- …and more!

See the [Call For Participants](/cfp) for more details on participation. Importantly, we hope to provide travel grants for participants selected for the workshop that should cover most or all of the costs of attendance (travel to Chicago, meals, lodging).
