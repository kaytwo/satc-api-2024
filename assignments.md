title: 1 on 1 Assignments
---

Please see below for your one on one discussion assignments. There are three sessions: 2:30pm, 3:00pm, and 5:30 pm. Experienced PIs (EPIs) stay in the same room between 2:30 and 3. Aspiring PIs (APIs) switch rooms every 30 minutes.  Within each room, there are enough experienced PIs such that every aspiring PI in that time slot can have one 5 minute conversation with an experienced PI / program officer. For Aspiring PIs, when you are not currently speaking with an EPI/PO, we encourage you to network with / pitch your project ideas to other aspiring PIs in yoru session.

Please keep your discussions to 5 minutes each so that everyone gets a chance to chat.
