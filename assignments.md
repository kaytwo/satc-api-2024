title: 2024 NSF SaTC Aspiring PI Workshop one-on-one assignments
---

Please see below for your one on one discussion assignments. There are three sessions: 2:30pm, 3:00pm, and 5:30 pm.  Within each room, there are enough experienced PIs such that every aspiring PI in that time slot can have a 5 minute conversation with each experienced PI / program officer. Please keep your discussions to 5 minutes each so that everyone gets a chance to chat.
