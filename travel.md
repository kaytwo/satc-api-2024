## Travel Arrangements

The 2024 SaTC Aspiring PI Workshop will take place at the John Crerar Library (JCL), home of the University of Chicago's Department of Computer Science. The JCL building is located at 5730 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637. The University of Chicago is situated in the Hyde Park neighborhood, convenient to both Midway and O'Hare airports, and is also easily reachable by CTA Bus and Metra Commuter Rail. University shuttle buses and CTA routes #171 and #172 stop in front of the bookstore or Levi Hall on the other side of Ellis Ave.

We recommend parking in University garages at 55th Street & Ellis or 57th Street & Cottage Grove. A map of all UChicago parking options is available [here](https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/safety-security/uploads/files/2019_Parking_map_11.27.19.pdf?mtime=1575909818).

## Hotel Accommodations

Accepted aspiring PIs have been booked at the [Godfrey Hotel Chicago](https://www.godfreyhotelchicago.com/). You should have received email from the organizers about these arrangements; please contact them if you have not. We are paying the hotel directly for the cost of the booking; you would only be responsible for incidentals. The hotel is easily accessible by the [CTA](https://www.transitchicago.com/) (Chicago's public transportation authority) from both O'Hare and Midway Airports.

## Booking and Reimbursement Support

We have offered travel grants to cover most or all of attendees' travel costs associated with participation in the workshop (airfare, meals) in addition to covering their lodging expenses. Additional information regarding travel grants was sent over email to all accepted attendees.
