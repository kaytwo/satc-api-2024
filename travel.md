## Travel Arrangements

The 2024 SaTC Aspiring PI Workshop will take place at Crerar Library, home of the UChicago CS Department, located at 730 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637. The University of Chicago is situated in the Hyde Park neighborhood, convenient to both Midway and O'Hare airports, and is also easily reachable by CTA Bus, Metra Commuter Rail, and Amtrak.

If you are taking a rideshare or taxi to the event, it is often best to choose the University of Chicago bookstore (970 E. 58th Street) as your destination, then walk west past it and northwest across the small quad to the John Crerar Library. University shuttle buses and CTA routes #171 and #172 also stop in front of the bookstore or Levi Hall on the other side of Ellis Ave.

For short visits, metered street parking is often available on Ellis Avenue. For longer visits, or during peak hours, we recommend parking in University garages at 55th Street & Ellis or 57th Street & Cottage Grove. A map of all UChicago parking options is available [here](https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/safety-security/uploads/files/2019_Parking_map_11.27.19.pdf?mtime=1575909818).

## Booking and Reimbursement Support
