## Travel Arrangements

The 2024 SaTC Aspiring PI Workshop will take place at the John Crerar Library (JCL), home of the University of Chicago's Department of Computer Science. The JCL building is located at 5730 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637. The University of Chicago is situated in the Hyde Park neighborhood, convenient to both Midway and O'Hare airports, and is also easily reachable by CTA Bus, Metra Commuter Rail, and Amtrak.

If you are taking a rideshare or taxi to the event, it is often best to choose the University of Chicago bookstore (970 E. 58th Street) as your destination, then walk west past it and northwest across the small quad to the John Crerar Library. University shuttle buses and CTA routes #171 and #172 also stop in front of the bookstore or Levi Hall on the other side of Ellis Ave.

We recommend parking in University garages at 55th Street & Ellis or 57th Street & Cottage Grove. A map of all UChicago parking options is available [here](https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/safety-security/uploads/files/2019_Parking_map_11.27.19.pdf?mtime=1575909818).

## Hotel Accommodations

Room blocks and suggested hotels will be provided when participants are invited.

## Booking and Reimbursement Support

We expect to offer travel grants to cover most or all of attendees' travel costs associated with participation in the workshop (airfare, meals, lodging). Additional information regarding travel grants, booking, and room blocks will be forthcoming.
